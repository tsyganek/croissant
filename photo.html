        <h1>10 Fun Facts About Croissants</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Croissants were born not in France, but in Austria and date back
              to the end of 17th century. Croissants are descendants of a pastry
              named kipfel which is a kind of bread roll known since 13th
              century.
            </p>

              In France, croissants appeared in the 19th century. Maria
              Antoinette, the queen of France, introduced this treat to the
              royal kitchen to be baked just for her. In public, croissants
              appeared in Paris in Boulangerie Vennoise. A bakery under the same
              name still exists in the capital of France, but it is not the
              mother of croissants.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The most important ingredient in croissants is unsalted butter,
              which is spread on the dough layer by layer before baking. This is
              what gives the croissant its signature buttery flavor.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A classic French croissant has 55 layers (27 layers of butter),
              achieved with a French fold followed by 3 letter folds
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Croissant dough needs to rest for 24 hours before being baked.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Nineteenth-century croissants had 2 sizes (1 sou, 36-37 grams, and
              2 sous, 60-80 grams).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In 1920, the croissant was awarded the place of the national
              product of France.
            </p>

              The USA and Canada have a special day celebrating the existence of
              croissants. So, the National Croissant Day in the USA is January
              30.

              French croissants have relatives in other European cuisines ‚Äì
              German laugencroissants, Italian cornettos, Polish rogals
              ≈õwiƒôtomarci≈Ñski, and gipfels from Switzerland.

              Starting out as a food item for nobles, in the beginning, the dish
              soon became a dish relished by everyone.
